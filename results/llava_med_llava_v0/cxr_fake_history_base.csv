 There is probable background hyperinflation/COPD.
 
 There is mild cardiomegaly.  The aortic and hilar contours are obscured by the
 surrounding parenchymal changes.
 
 There are extensive increased interstitial markings in both lungs, with more
 honeycomb appearance in the right upper zone.  The appearance is suggestive of
 chronic parenchymal scarring, but the possibility of a superimposed
 interstitial process or interstitial edema would be difficult to exclude. 
 Probable background blebs and bullae in both lungs.
 
 Minimal blunting of left-greater-than-right costophrenic angles.  Increased
 retrocardiac opacity, also of uncertain etiology or acuity.  Asymmetric left
 apical pleural thickening noted.
 
 A metallic BB overlies the right lung base.  Based on this single frontal

 lateral portion of the right clavicle at the level of the coracoid.  No

 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is rotated. Lung volumes are low, overall unchanged.  Large right
 pleural effusion has decreased in size, now moderate.  Small left pleural
 effusion is overall unchanged.  Interval decrease in edema, now mild. 
 Bilateral atelectasis is overall unchanged.  The heart is mildly enlarged and
 overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The trachea is deviated rightward and
 could be potentially explain by a predominantly larger left goiter a noted on
 recent CT; however, deviation is slightly more prominent on radiograph
 compared to prior exams in in the setting of recent left internal jugular vein
 placement, correlation for possible hematoma is recommended.

 upward in the SVC with the tip now in the upper SVC.  The ETT is in standard

 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are flattened diaphragms suggestive of probable background COPD. 
 However, on the frontal view, inspiratory volumes are relatively low.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis.  No air bronchograms or confluent opacity to suggest
 focal consolidation.  No CHF.  Minimal blunting of left costophrenic angle. 
 No gross effusion.  Allowing for low lung volumes, the cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is likely unchanged.

 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, allowing for significant differences in positioning and technique,
 the appearance is similar to ___.  However, the CHF findings are
 probably slightly more pronounced.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  The rounded, masslike opacity at the left lung apexmay be
 accentuated by differences in positioning, but is otherwise similar.  Changes
 at the left base including pleural fluid and/or thickening are similar to the
 prior study.
